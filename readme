Routebop is a project to help me learn basic web programming using node.js, express, mongdodb and ejs templating.

Next steps
- possibly investigate socket.io and realtime monitoring to record data as person wanders
- use flickr and instagram APIs to add photos
- tidy up interface
- consider a JS framework instead of relying on jQuery
- improve internal app structure by using MVC structure to a greater extent
- clean up JS into a separate file
